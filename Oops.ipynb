        "1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data (attributes or properties) and code (methods or functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is a class in OOP\n",
        "- A class defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is an object in OOP\n",
        "- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a real-world entity or instance of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "- Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
        "- Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within one unit (class), and restricting access to some of the object’s components.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        "- Dunder methods (short for \"Double UNDERscore\" methods) are special magic methods in Python that start and end with double underscores\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "- Inheritance is an OOP concept that allows a new class (called the child or subclass) to reuse the properties and methods of an existing class (called the parent or superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "- Polymorphism means \"many forms\",it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, and behave differently based on their actual class.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        "- Encapsulation is the OOP principle of bundling data and methods that operate on that data, and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is a constructor in Python\n",
        "- In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize objects when they are created from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        "- A class method is bound to the class, not the instance. It can access or modify class state using the cls parameter.\n",
        "- A static method is not bound to the class or the instance. It behaves like a regular function, but belongs to the class's namespace.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is method overloading in Python\n",
        "-  Method Overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What is method overriding in OOP\n",
        "- Method Overriding is an OOP feature where a child class provides a new implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        "- The @property decorator in Python is used to define a method that can be accessed like an attribute, while still allowing logic behind the scenes without explicitly calling it like a method.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        "- Polymorphism — meaning \"many forms\" — is a core pillar of OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface, while behaving differently based on their class.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be inherited by subclasses that implement its abstract methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What are the advantages of OOP\n",
        "- OOP is a powerful programming paradigm that structures software around objects — reusable pieces of code that contain data (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        "- In Object-Oriented Programming, especially in Python, class variables and instance variables are used to store data — but they differ in scope, purpose, and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This means a child class can have the behaviors and properties of multiple superclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "- In Python, __str__() and __repr__() are special (dunder) methods used to define how an object should be converted to a string — for users and developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        "- The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (or superclass) inside a child (or subclass) — especially when working with inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "- The __del__() method in Python is a special method (also called a destructor) that is called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed — typically when its reference count drops to zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "- @staticmethod\n",
        "Does not take self or cls as the first parameter\n",
        "- @classmethod\n",
        "Takes cls as the first parameter (not self)\n",
        "\n",
        "23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n",
        "- Polymorphism means “many forms” — it allows different classes to define methods with the same name, and Python will call the appropriate one at runtime, depending on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.What is method chaining in Python OOP\n",
        "- Method chaining is a programming technique where multiple methods are called in a single line, one after another, using the dot (.) operator.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function."
